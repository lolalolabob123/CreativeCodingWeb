For this technique I decided to use truchet tiles. They as a way to display shapes or content in a grid, whilst also alowing the shapes to be rotated in order to create multiple unique designs without having to change much of the code. Furthermore, truchet tiles can have any number of rotations allowing for even more variations.

This first version of the truchet tile uses circles to create a pattern bu rotateing the circles from a point creating a cool affect. I also used a range of colors between black and grey to allow for a more unique pattern as well.

For this second version of the design I added an extra pattern, making the design slightlyn more clutteredd but still keeping a simple design. I also changed the color of this pattern so that there was not only more shape variastion but also more colour variation. However, I feel like it now looks too random compared to the previous design.

For this final design, I decided to go back to a simpler apprach by using lines instead of circles or other patterns. I then decided to focus more on the colours and hosI could use them in a more meaningful way. I decided to allow the lines to have four possible rotations, I then set a different colour to each or these possible rotations or 'states' of the lines in order to create a more unique pattern with the colours.
