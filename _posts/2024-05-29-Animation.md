  I used a circle and made it change size and position to make it appear as if it is an animation. This is done by using the frame count in order to make sure that the circle changes at the correct time in order to make it seem like it is mobing fluidly.

  This experiment shows a circle that expands and changes colour and then reverses back to its original state at the smae speed. This helps to create a looping effect which is sometimes necessary to create a seemeless animation.

  This final experiment uses animation to move the circles when they are click and moves them when they collide with eachother.
