  <p>I used random shapes and colours to display how randomness can create something unexpected and unique. This experiment doesn't serve any purpose or have much of a meaning but it helps to display the features of random when using shapes and colours.</p>

  <p>This experiment shows how you can use random to create a pattern or kind of animation. It also shows how you can randomise between two different colours rather than having to use complete randomness.</p>
